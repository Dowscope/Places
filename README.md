# Project-Places
This project will further my knowledge on an open world 2D Game.  I'm developing this on a linux machine.  Yes it should compile to a windows box, but I just want to put that out there.

## First Step
Creating a window using SDL

## Bugs
Please create Issues if you find any bugs.  I will fix them asap.
